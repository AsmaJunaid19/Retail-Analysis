# Retail-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the **Online Retail dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, focusing on customer behavior and product purchase patterns. The key steps of the project include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data for accurate analysis, including handling missing values and duplicates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gained insights into product sales, top customers, and sales by country.
- **RFM Analysis:** Segmented customers based on **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** value to identify loyal, at-risk, and average customers.
- **Frequent Itemset Mining:** Used the **Apriori algorithm** to uncover product associations and cross-selling opportunities.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Analyzed monthly sales data to identify seasonal peaks for informed marketing and inventory planning.

The project provides actionable insights and recommendations for improving customer retention, engagement, and marketing strategies. Visualizations include RFM segment distribution, top customer revenue contributions, frequent itemsets, and seasonal sales trends.
